This project demonstrates the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques on a given dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and insights. The goal of EDA is to analyze data sets by summarizing their main characteristics, often visualizing them to discover patterns, relationships, and anomalies.
